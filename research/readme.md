# Repositories

## Neural style transfer

- [Real Time Style Transfer](https://github.com/jsigee87/real-time-style-transfer) - A real time neural style transfer project for EE 461P Data Science Principles, at the University of Texas at Austin. This code is associated with the blog post [Real Time Video Neural Style Transfer](https://towardsdatascience.com/real-time-video-neural-style-transfer-9f6f84590832).


# Implementations

## Model compression
